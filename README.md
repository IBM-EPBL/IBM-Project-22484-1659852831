### OVERVIEW

The Internet of Things (IoT) is an innovative technology that offers practical and dependable answers for the modernization of numerous fields. Solutions built on the Internet of Things are being created to maintain and monitor agricultural farms with the least amount of human participation. The content covers a wide range of technological elements related to IoT in agriculture. The key elements of IoT-based smart farming are explained. Network architecture and layers, network topologies, and protocols have all been thoroughly discussed in relation to network technologies used in IoT-based agriculture. Additionally, it has been demonstrated how IoT-based farm systems may work with pertinent technologies like cloud computing, big data storage, and analytics.

### CONCLUSION

The majority of nations depend heavily on agriculture as a source of employment. In a nation like India, irrigation makes up a considerable share of total water use. The temperature of the immediate environment, the temperature of the soil, and the relative humidity are a few of the variables that affect crop productivity. The Internet of Things (IoT) has many advantages, including increased effectiveness, reduced costs, efficient energy use, forecasting, and public convenience.
